Digital wallets provide an important function for people interacting and transacting on the Libra payment network. In this section, you will learn about the Libra Reference Wallet, find technical and conceptual documentation, and information for integrating services with the Libra Payment network.

The upcoming Libra Reference Wallet, for web and mobile, will demonstrate key technical, design, and regulatory considerations for wallet developers of all sizes.

For developers with existing digital wallets or familiarity building digital financial products, we will publish an integration guide to help you prepare for mainnet.

For this and future announcements, be sure to sign up for the [developer newsletter](/newsletter_form).
