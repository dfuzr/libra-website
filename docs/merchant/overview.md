We are developing a reference merchant project for developers. The project will demonstrate how your service can accept â‰‹Libra payments Libra online, in-app, and in-person.

In this section, you will find the upcoming Libra Reference Merchant project, relevant technical and conceptual documentation, and technical specifications.

Merchant services providers who would like to enable Libra payments on their platforms will need:
  * To be a regulated Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP). Review the requirements [here](https://libra.org/white-paper/#compliance-and-the-prevention-of-illicit-activity)
  * To provide or partner with a custody service to securely hold assets.
  * To provide or partner  with a liquidity service to support the exchange of funds between fiat and supported Libra currencies.
<br />

<p className="margin-top--none">These services can be put in place now to set your business up to facilitate payments on the Libra Payment Network.</p>
